# Introduction

## What is HiView?
_HiView_ is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based web application for visualizing hierarchical data generated by the [DDOT](http://ddot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) pipeline.  Reference implementation is available here:

http://hiview.ucsd.edu/

## Quick start guide for users

To try this viewer, click the **EXAMPLES** button to select a pre-computed hierarchy and press **START**.  Some of the examples are relatively large, and it may take a while to load.

Once the hierarchy is loaded, double-click any one of the subsystems (any ciecles in the view) to expand internal substructures. It automatically load original raw interaction data stored in [NDEx](http://test.ndexbio.org).

### Options

#### Automatic gene set enrichment analysys by Enrichr

You can automatically send the member genes in the subsystem to [Enrichr](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) to perform gene set enrichment analysis.  By default, this option is turned off.  To enable this, just ckick the **huburger menu** icon on the top-left top open the Control Panel.  And then turn on the **Automatically run gene set analysis with Enricher** option.  Once you click any of the subsystems, the list of genes will be sent to the server and the analysys result will be displayed on the bottom panel.
